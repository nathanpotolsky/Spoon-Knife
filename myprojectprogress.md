I am still interested in creating or contributing to an open source Discreet Math calculator.  I have often longed to be able to check my discreet math homework the same way I can for my Calculus homework.  There exist Calculus calculators, why not a Discreet Math one as well?  I looked into it, and I didn't find any existing open-source Discreet Math Calculators, so if I wanted to do that, I'd have to start it myself.  As far as open source math programs go, I looked at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_software_for_mathematics to get some ideas.  SciPy and Graph looked interesting to mebut they all seem like I wouldn't be able to contribute much to.  I don't feel my ability in programming is strong enough yet to be able to do that yet.  I think working with my classmates on a project together would be fun.  I am interested in working on most anything though, the open-source project wouldn't have to be math related.
